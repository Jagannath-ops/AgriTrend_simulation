# An Apology

### Due to delays and access restrictions in obtaining official government agricultural datasets, I COULD NOT get the official real world data.
> The prototype currently uses synthetically generated but statistically realistic data to validate the analytical pipeline.

**The pseudo-data is generated using controlled distributions and domain-inspired assumptions**
(e.g., rainfall variability, soil fertility bounds, noise factors such as pests and practices).

This approach allows us to:
- validate system correctness
- test sensitivity and scenario analysis
- demonstrate research methodology

---
**The system is designed so that real tabular datasets (CSV/Excel) can replace the synthetic data without any architectural changes.**
