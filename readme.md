# `AgriTrend_simulation.py`

### Crop Yield Trend Analysis Simulator 
The objective of this prototype is to design and demonstrate a structured, explainable framework for analyzing agricultural yield trends and exploring future outcomes using statistically grounded, transparent methods.

The prototype is intended to:
- Model the relationships between environmental, soil, and management factors and crop yield
- Demonstrate a clear end-to-end data pipeline, from data generation to analysis and visualization
- Enable scenario-based exploration of future yield outcomes under controlled assumptions
- Serve as a foundation for integrating real-world datasets in later development stages
- This prototype prioritizes interpretability, methodological clarity, and system design over predictive complexity.

This project is built as part of **Hack The Winter** hackathon and focuses on concept validation, system thinking, and research-oriented analysis rather than UI polish.
